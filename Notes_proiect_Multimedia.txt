this.#context.beginPath();
This begins a new path on the canvas. Paths are sequences of points that define shapes, lines, or outlines. beginPath(), we tell the canvas that weâ€™re starting a new shape.

this.#context.moveTo(centerX, centerY - size);
This sets the starting point of the path to the top vertex of the triangle.
 Since we want the triangle to point upwards, we move to a point size units above the center (centerY - size).
moveTo(x, y) moves the drawing cursor to the specified coordinates without drawing anything.

this.#context.lineTo(centerX - size * 0.87, centerY + size * 0.5);
This draws a line from the current point (the top vertex) to the bottom-left vertex of the triangle.
lineTo(x, y) draws a straight line from the current point to the specified coordinates.
centerX - size * 0.87 moves the x-coordinate leftward, and centerY + size * 0.5 moves the y-coordinate downward. 
This positions the bottom-left vertex of the triangle below the top vertex and slightly to the left.
0.87 is an approximation of the cosine of 30 degrees, and 0.5 is the sine of 30 degrees, which helps us position the points for an equilateral triangle.

this.#context.closePath();
This closes the path by connecting the last point (the bottom-right vertex) back to the starting point (the top vertex), completing the triangle shape.
closePath() draws a line back to the starting point, ensuring the shape is enclosed.
